Create directory trees and file names in your browser and validate .gitignore pattern syntax against the given tree.

Will use [@gerhobbelt/gitignore-parser](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@gerhobbelt/gitignore-parser) as its backend and as such uses
the same license.

Currently unfinished.

Unrelated:

This uses Vite and its defaults to "create a Vite app".
This also means using Rollup and ESBuild under the hood.

This project also uses PostCSS, which still hasn't fully transitioned to ECMAScript modules yet.

I like PostCSS, I don't like Rollup, all of that is irrelevant here.

I like Vite, it's very easy to set up and works really well.
